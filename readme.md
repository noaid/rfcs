## noaid rfcs
When making substantial changes to the noaid core modules, we use “request for comments” workflow to formalize the design process and allow the community to join the conversation.

A substantial change may be one that introduces a new feature, deprecates something, or is otherwise complex enough to warrant some attention from the community.

This repository serves as a way to propose such RFCs, and as a log of accepted RFCs, which may be valuable for later reference.
